# INFO 1300 (SP26) - Activity - Chatty

In this activity we will explore using built-in Ai chat.

This is a practice activity - not for credit. Feel free to expand as inspired.

Open this repository as a Codespace on GitHub.

## Instructions 

- Notice the file structure in the left pane.
  
- Add the HTML boilerplate code to chatty.html using the chat. Using a prompt similar to this:
  
    `Add the HTML boilerplate code to chatty.html`

- Generate some basic copy for a weather forecast that we can use to add to the page.  Using a prompt similar to this:

    `Generate copy for a 7 day weather forecast for Ithaca, NY.  Text only.  No HTML or CSS code.  Place the copy in chatty.txt`

- Structure the copy.  Using a prompt similar to this:

    `Structure the copy in chatty.txt.  HTML code only.  No CSS code.  Add this to chatty.html`

    Notice it provides lots of stuff we have not learned (or need).  Strip that out.
